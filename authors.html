	 The only memory twelve-year old Calvin has of his father is a cheap wrist watch. But when that watch suddenly starts running backwards, Calvin finds himself tired, hungry and alone in a medieval village — nine-hundred years in the past.
There, along with a few orphaned friends, he must battle dwarves, dragons, and dark magic — and the brutal truth of who his own father has become.
